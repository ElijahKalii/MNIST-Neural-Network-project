# MNIST-Neural-Network-project
Handwritten digits classifier Neural Networks project

Uses Pytorch deep learning library to identify and classify handwritten digit images. I use the famous MNIST database of 7000 handwritten images with numbers 0 to 9 (10 classes).  
By running 5 epochs, learning rate of 0.01 and batches of 100 features, I am able to achieve a 90.6% accuracy. With various hyperparameters, the model can achieve as high as 99%
This will take more training time though.
